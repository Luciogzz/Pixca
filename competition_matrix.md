| Feature | 🥬 **Pixca** (Us) | 🤖 **NXTAgro** | 💧 **Kilimo** | 🛰️ **Aedrotec** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Primary Target** | **Small/Med Farmers** | Export Giants | Mid-Large Farms | Ag-Engineers |
| **Hardware cost** | **$ (Low)** | $$$ (High) | N/A (Software only) | $$ (Medium) |

## Why We Win
1.  **Accessibility**: We are the *only* ones using WhatsApp as the primary interface, removing the "digital divide" barrier.
2.  **Price**: Our hardware is 1/5th the cost of NXTAgro's industrial nodes.
3.  **Trust**: Unlike Kilimo (algorithms only), we give farmers *physical sensors* they can touch and see, building trust in the data.
